    "Ans: Database : A database is information that is set up for easy access, management and updating  information efficiently. \n",
    "                In essence, it's an organized system for storing and retrieving information.\n",
    "            \n",
    "    Differences:\n",
    "    SQL databases are relational and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "    NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, column-based, or graph-based, providing flexibility\n",
    "    in data representation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SQL stores data in the tabular for and can store the csv data , json data.\n",
    "    NoSQL Stores data in the the file structure.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SQL databases usually scale vertically by adding more power (CPU, RAM, SSD) to an existing machine.\n",
    "    NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally across many servers, making it easier to handle \n",
    "    large amounts of data and high loads.\n",
